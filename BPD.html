        <h2> <u>What is Borderline Personalitiy Disorder</u>?</h2>
       <h3> Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that severely impacts a person’s ability to regulate their emotions. This loss of emotional control can increase impulsivity, affect how a person feels about themselves, and negatively impact their relationships with others. Effective treatments are available to manage the symptoms of borderline personality disorder.
       </h3>
    </p>

	<p>
		<h2><u>What are types of Borderline Personalitiy disorder?</u></h2>
        <h3>
			There are four types of BPD. You can be diagnosed with more than one type at the same time or at different times.
            <center> <img src="images/BPD2.jpg" width="30%"  style="border: 3px solid black;"></center><br>
			<ul>
			<ol> 1. <u> Impulsive Borderline Personality Disorder</u> – Impulsive behavior is a primary symptom of BPD. A person with BPD can act in impulsive and often dangerous ways. They may do this without regard for others or possible consequences.</ol>

            <ol>3) Aggressive behaviors: Outbursts, physical fights, breaking things, hitting things, yelling fits</ol></br>


            <ol> 2.  <u>Discouraged Borderline Personality Disorder</u> – This is also known as quiet borderline personality disorder. People with this type are afraid of being abandoned. They may take extreme actions to prevent real or imagined abandonment.
            Compared to people with other types of BPD, people with this type may keep their emotions inside. They also tend to blame themselves rather than others.</ol>
            <u><li>Discouraged types may:</li></u>
            <ol>1) Be perfectionists</ol>
            <ol>2) Be very successful</ol>
            <ol>3) Be high functioning</ol>
            <ol>4) Feel alienated and detached in groups</ol>
            <ol>5) Feel like they don’t have real or strong bonds with others</ol>
            <ol>6) Seek approval but also self-isolate</ol>
            <ol>7) Engage in self-harm or suicidal behavior</ol>
            <ol>8) Feel lonely and empty a lot of the time</ol>
            
            <u><li>Signs of discouraged BPD include:</li></u>
            <ol>1) Clinginess</ol>
            <ol>2) Codependency</ol>
            <ol>3) Neediness</ol>
            <ol>4) Anger and emotional mood swings if abandonment issues get triggered</ol></br>

			
            <ol> 3.  <u>Self-Destructive Borderline Personality Disorder</u> – People with this type of BPD struggle with self-hatred and often feel bitter.</ol>
            <u><li>Symptoms of self-destructive BPD are similar to those of other conditions. Look out for these additional symptoms:</li></u>
            <ol>1) An increase in energy</ol>
            <ol>2) A decrease in the desire to sleep</ol>
            <ol>3) Feelings of euphoria</ol>
            
            <u><li>Signs of discouraged BPD include:</li></u>
            <ol>1) Substance abuse: This includes recreational drugs and prescription medications.</ol>
            <ol>2) Risky adrenaline-seeking activities: People with this type of BPD may do these activities without preparing for them first.</ol>
            <ol>3) Self-harm behaviors: These may include cutting, burning, scratching, or hitting.</ol>
            <ol>4) Threats of suicide</ol></br>

            
            <ol> 4.  <u>Petulant Borderline Personality Disorder</u> – People with this type of BPD may be angry one moment and sad or sulky the next. They may swing unpredictably between one emotion and another. They may also feel unworthy and unloved. This can lead to relationship challenges and an unhealthy desire for control.
            People with this type of BPD can be manipulative. They often feel very dissatisfied in their relationships. Substance abuse and other dangerous behaviors often follow.</ol>
            <u><li>Example behaviors of people with this type of BPD include:</li></u>
            <ol>1) Irritability and impatience</ol>
            <ol>2) Stubbornness and defiance</ol>
            <ol>3) Passive-aggressiveness</ol>
            <ol>4) Severe mood swings</ol></br>

		<h2><u>What are the symptoms of Borderline Personalitiy disorder?</u></h2>
        <h3>
            People with borderline personality disorder may experience intense mood swings and feel uncertainty about how they see themselves. Their feelings for others can change quickly, and swing from extreme closeness to extreme dislike. These changing feelings can lead to unstable relationships and emotional pain.
        People with borderline personality disorder also tend to view things in extremes, such as all good or all bad. Their interests and values can change quickly, and they may act impulsively or recklessly.<br>
				<center><img src="images/BPD3.jpg" width="30%"  style="border: 3px solid black;"></center>
				<U>symptoms and signs:</U>
				<ol>
					<li>An intense fear of abandonment, even going to extreme measures to avoid real or imagined separation or rejection</li>
					<li>A pattern of unstable intense relationships, such as idealizing someone one moment and then suddenly believing the person doesn't care enough or is cruel</li>
					<li>Rapid changes in self-identity and self-image that include shifting goals and values, and seeing yourself as bad or as if you don't exist at all</li>
					<li>Periods of stress-related paranoia and loss of contact with reality, lasting from a few minutes to a few hours</li>
					<li>Impulsive and risky behavior, such as gambling, reckless driving, unsafe sex, spending sprees, binge eating or drug abuse, or sabotaging success by suddenly quitting a good job or ending a positive relationship</li>
					<li>Suicidal threats or behavior or self-injury, often in response to fear of separation or rejection</li>
					<li>Wide mood swings lasting from a few hours to a few days, which can include intense happiness, irritability, shame or anxiety</li>
					<li>Ongoing feelings of emptiness</li>
                    <li>Inappropriate, intense anger, such as frequently losing your temper, being sarcastic or bitter, or having physical fights</li>

		<h2><u>What risk factor for Borderline personality Disorder?</u></h2>
		    <h3>
                Researchers aren’t sure what causes borderline personality disorder, but studies suggest that genetic, environmental, and social factors may increase the risk of developing it. These factors may include:
		<ol>
			1. <U> Family history</U>:People who have a close family member (such as a parent or sibling) with the illness may be at a higher risk of developing borderline personality disorder.<br>
            
	    </ol>
	    <ol>
		    2. <U> Brain structure and function</U>: Research shows that people with borderline personality disorder may have structural and functional changes in the brain, especially in the areas that control impulses and emotion regulation. However, the studies do not demonstrate whether these changes were risk factors for the illness or if such changes were caused by the disorder.<br>
		    
	    </ol>	
		<ol> 
			3. <u> Environmental, cultural, and social factors</u>: Many people with borderline personality disorder report experiencing traumatic life events, such as abuse, abandonment, or hardship during childhood. Others may have been exposed to unstable, invalidating relationships or conflicts.<br>
        </ol>

    </p>

	<p>
		<h2><u>What causes Borderline personality Disorder?</u></h2>
		    <h3>
                As with other mental health disorders, the causes of borderline personality disorder aren't fully understood. In addition to environmental factors — such as a history of child abuse or neglect — borderline personality disorder may be linked to:
		<ol>
			<B> 1. <U> Genetics </U></B><br>
            Some studies of twins and families suggest that personality disorders may be inherited or strongly associated with other mental health disorders among family members.
	    </ol>
	    <ol>
		    <B> 2. <U> Brain abnormalities </U></B><br>
		    Some research has shown changes in certain areas of the brain involved in emotion regulation, impulsivity and aggression. In addition, certain brain chemicals that help regulate mood, such as serotonin, may not function properly.

	    </ol>	
            </h3>
    </p>
	<br/>


	<p>
		<h2><u>Conditions That Can Co-Occur With Borderline personality Disorder</u></h2>
		<h3>
            Borderline personality disorder often occurs with other mental illnesses, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These co-occurring disorders can make it harder to diagnose and treat borderline personality disorder, especially if symptoms of other illnesses overlap with symptoms of the disorder. For example, a person with borderline personality disorder also may be more likely to experience symptoms of major depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, or eating disorders.
		
		</h3>
	</p>
	<br/>


	<p>
		<h2><u>How is Borderline personality disorder Diagnosed?</u></h2>
		<h3>
        Personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder, are diagnosed based on a:
		<ol>
			<B>1. Detailed interview with your doctor or mental health provider</B> <br>
		</ol>
		<ol>	
			<B>2. Psychological evaluation that may include completing questionnaires.</B> <br>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<B>3. Medical history and exam.</B> <br>
        </ol>
        <ol>
			<B>4. Discussion of your signs and symptoms.</B> <br>
        </ol>
        A diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is usually made in adults, not in children or teenagers. That's because what appear to be signs and symptoms of borderline personality disorder may go away as children get older and become more mature.
		</h3>
	</p>
	<br/>



	<p>
		<h2><u>Treatments and Therapies.</u></h2>
	    <h3>
			Borderline personality disorder is mainly treated using psychotherapy, but medication may be added. Your doctor also may recommend hospitalization if your safety is at risk.
        Treatment can help you learn skills to manage and cope with your condition. It's also necessary to get treated for any other mental health disorders that often occur along with borderline personality disorder, such as depression or substance misuse. With treatment, you can feel better about yourself and live a more stable, rewarding life.

        <ol>
			<B>1. <u>Psychotherapy</u> </B> <br>
		    Psychotherapy — also called talk therapy — is a fundamental treatment approach for borderline personality disorder. Your therapist may adapt the type of therapy to best meet your needs. The goals of psychotherapy are to help you:
		<li>Focus on your current ability to function</li>
        <li>Learn to manage emotions that feel uncomfortable</li>
        <li>Reduce your impulsiveness by helping you observe feelings rather than acting on them</li>
        <li>Work on improving relationships by being aware of your feelings and those of others</li>
        <li>Learn about borderline personality disorder</li></br>

        <u><ol>Types of psychotherapy that have been found to be effective include:</ol></u>
        <ol>1) <u>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</u> - DBT includes group and individual therapy designed specifically to treat borderline personality disorder. DBT uses a skills-based approach to teach you how to manage your emotions, tolerate distress and improve relationships.</ol>
        <ol>2) <u>Schema-focused therapy</u> - Schema-focused therapy can be done individually or in a group. It can help you identify unmet needs that have led to negative life patterns, which at some time may have been helpful for survival, but as an adult are hurtful in many areas of your life. Therapy focuses on helping you get your needs met in a healthy manner to promote positive life patterns.</ol>
        <ol>3) <u>Mentalization-based therapy (MBT)</u> - MBT is a type of talk therapy that helps you identify your own thoughts and feelings at any given moment and create an alternate perspective on the situation. MBT emphasizes thinking before reacting.</ol>
        <ol>4) <u>Systems training for emotional predictability and problem-solving (STEPPS)</u> - STEPPS is a 20-week treatment that involves working in groups that incorporate your family members, caregivers, friends or significant others into treatment. STEPPS is used in addition to other types of psychotherapy</ol>
        <ol>5) <u>Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP)</u> - Also called psychodynamic psychotherapy, TFP aims to help you understand your emotions and interpersonal difficulties through the developing relationship between you and your therapist. You then apply these insights to ongoing situations.</ol>
        <ol>6) <u>Good psychiatric management</u> - This treatment approach relies on case management, anchoring treatment in an expectation of work or school participation. It focuses on making sense of emotionally difficult moments by considering the interpersonal context for feelings. It may integrate medications, groups, family education and individual therapy.</ol>
        </ol></br>


		<ol>	
			<B>2.<u>Medications</u> </B> <br>
			Although no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specifically for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, certain medications may help with symptoms or co-occurring problems such as depression, impulsiveness, aggression or anxiety. Medications may include antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood-stabilizing drugs.
