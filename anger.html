        <h2> <u>What are Anger Issues?</u></h2>
       <h3><li>Anger is a normal human reaction and can be effective and beneficial in certain situations, like responding to threats of injury or harm to yourself or others. Not being able to control anger, however, can turn destructive and cause problems in your life, as well as negatively affect personal and professional relationships.</li>
            <li>Anger does not only affect your external relationships, it can also have negative effects on your health. Studies have shown that not being able to control your anger can lead to cardiovascular diseases, bulimia (a life-threatening eating disorder), diabetes, and road accidents. It is therefore important that psychological and medicinal treatments be considered when helping people deal with anger management issues.</li>
		    <li>There are many internal and external factors that lead to anger. Some internal factors can include mental instability, depression, or alcoholism. While external factors can include situations that cause stress or anxiety, financial or professional issues, or family and relationship problems.</li>

		<h2><u>What are types of Anger Issues?</u></h2>
        <h3>
			Anger can manifest itself in a number of different ways. Not all anger is expressed in the same way. Anger and aggression can be outward, inward, or passive.:
			<ul>
			<li> 1.<u>Inward Anger</u> – This type of anger is directed internally and can include dark and depressing thoughts and negative self-talk. Punishing yourself is usually associated with inward anger, like denying yourself things you enjoy doing, like watching television or working out. It can even mean denying yourself basic needs like food and water.</li> <br>
			<li> 2.<u>Outward Anger</u> – This involves expressing your anger verbally or physically toward other people and things. It can include breaking things and attacking other people, as well as shouting and cursing.  </li> <br>
			<li> 3.<u>Passive Anger</u> – Also known as passive-aggressive behavior, this can include actions like being sarcastic or degrading toward others, giving others the silent treatment, and sulking.</li> <br>
			
		</ul>

		<h2><u>What causes Anger Issues?</u></h2>
		    <h3>
				
		<li>Anger can be caused by either external or internal influences. A person or an event could make you angry. You could be angry because someone cut in line in front of you in line. You might feel angry when you are emotionally hurt, threatened, in pain, or in a confrontation. </li>
	    <li>Sometimes we use anger to replace other emotions we would rather not deal with, like emotional pain, fear, loneliness, or loss. In these cases, anger becomes a secondary emotion. Anger could be a reaction to physical pain, a response to feelings of fear, to protect yourself from a perceived attack, or in response to a frustrating situation.3</li>

	<p>
		<h2><u>Treatments and Therapies.</u></h2>
	    <h3>There are several ways that you can deal with anger management. Some of them you can do on your own, while others can include the help of friends, family, or mental health professionals. Strategies for managing your anger issues include:
			<ol><B>1. <U>Think Before Speaking</U></B>: Anger frequently rises in the heat of the moment. It is easy to say or do the first thing that comes to mind. Take a few moments, however, to take a deep breath and think about the situation and what you should say or do. Encourage others in the situation to do the same.</ol>
			<ol><B>2. <U>Express Your Anger in a Constructive Way</U></B>: Once you’ve taken a moment to calm down and can think clearly, try to express your feelings in an assertive but non-confrontational way. You can state the concerns and frustrations you have clearly and directly without hurting the other people involved.</ol>
		    <ol><B>3. <U>Identify Potential Solutions</U></B>: A lot of what drives anger is focusing on the problem in a situation. Try instead to direct your efforts to resolve whatever it is that is causing your anger. It is helpful to remind yourself that anger won't fix anything and it might actually make it worse.</ol>
		    <ol><B>4. <U>Stick With 'I' Statements</U></B>: Anger drives people to find others to blame, which naturally leads to finger-pointing. A constructive way to address a situation that is causing you anger is to frame it as an ‘I’ statement. For example, "I'm upset that you left the table without offering to help with the dishes" instead of "You never do any housework".</ol>
		    <ol><B>5. <U>Let Go of Grudges</U></B>: Being able to forgive can dramatically decrease feelings of anger and lead to finding a solution to a problem. Forgiveness is a powerful tool and can be used effectively to deal with anger issues. </ol>
		    <ol><B>6. <u>Use Humor</u></B>: Injecting a little humor into a tense situation can go a long way in lowering the intensity of the moment. It can even shed light on the situation, and you might realize it’s not that terrible. Be careful not to use sarcasm, however, as that can hurt others’ feelings and make things worse. </ol>

		<h2><u>Beyond Treatment you can also do.</u></h2>
		<h3>
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Regular Excercise</u> </B> <br>
			Regular aerobic exercise, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or bicycling, helps with depression and anxiety, promotes better sleep, and is healthy for your heart and brain. There is also some evidence that anaerobic exercise such as weightlifting, yoga, and Pilates can be helpful. Check with your health care provider before you start a new exercise regimen.
		</ol>
		<ol>	
			<B>2. <u>Keeping a Life Chart</u> </B> <br>
			Even with proper treatment, mood changes can occur. Treatment is more effective when a patient and health care provider work together and talk openly about concerns and choices. Keeping a life chart that records daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events can help patients and health care providers track and treat bipolar disorder over time. Patients can easily share data collected via smartphone apps – including self-reports, self- ratings, and activity data – with their health care providers and therapists.
		</ol>

		<h2><u>Coping up with Anger.</u></h2>
		<h3>
			Finding ways to cope with anger is very important. When we allow anger to take control of our lives, it can affect everything we do. It can damage relationships with our loved ones and cause problems in our workplace. If you’ve been finding it difficult to keep your anger in check in certain situations, here are a couple of coping mechanisms that can help.
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Identify the Cause</u></B>: The first step to coping with anger is identifying the root cause of your anger. It could be another emotion—maybe one of fear or loneliness. It could be an altercation you had or an unpleasant thought that came to mind. <br>
			<B>2. <u>Meditate</u></B>: Meditation is very beneficial in helping to control human emotions. You can start with simple meditation techniques like deep breathing exercises. When faced with a situation that makes you angry, take a second before reacting. You can take several deep breaths to calm yourself or try to count until you feel yourself become calmer.  <br>
			<B>3. <u>Work Out</u></B>: Exercising isn’t just great for your physical health—it’s also beneficial for your mental health. It’s also a way to channel out emotions like anger in a useful and productive way. Going for a quick run or swim when you are angry could help defuse the emotion. <br>
			<B>4. <u>Let It Out</u></B>: Don’t bottle your anger up. Expressing your anger when you feel it is the healthiest way to get through it. Bottling up the emotion is most likely to cause a sudden and intense outburst when you least expect it.  <br>
			<B>5. <u>Avoid Triggers</u></B>: If you are quick to become angry, it’s useful to try to identify and avoid your triggers. If you are often triggered when having a conversation with a particular person or about a particular topic, avoid them or that topic until you’ve learned how to have better control over your anger. <br>
			</ol>
