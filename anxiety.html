        <h2><u><B>What is Anxiety Disorder?</B></u></h2>
       <h3> Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – Particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future.
		Anxiety is a natural human response when we feel that we are under threat. It can be experienced through our thoughts, feelings and physical sensations."For me, anxiety feels as if everyone in the world is waiting for me to trip up, so
		that they can laugh at me. It makes me feel nervous and unsure whether the next step I take is the best way forward."
		Most people feel anxious at times. It's particularly common to experience some anxiety while coping with stressful events or changes, especially if they could have a big impact
		on your life.

		<h2><u><B>What are Anxiety disorder?<B></u></h2>
        <h3>
			Anxiety can be experienced in lots of different ways. If your experiences meet certain criteria your doctor might diagnose you with a specific anxiety disorder.
			Some commonly diagnosed anxiety disorders are:
			<ul>
			<li> 1. <u> Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)</u> – This means having regular or uncontrollable worries about many different things in your everyday life. Because there are lots of possible symptoms of anxiety this can be quite a broad diagnosis, meaning that
			the problems you experience with GAD might be quite different from another person's experiences.</li> 
			<li> 2.  <u>Social anxiety disorder</u> – This diagnosis means you experience extreme fear or anxiety triggered by social situations (such as parties, workplaces, or everyday
			situations where you have to talk to another person). It is also known as social phobia. See our section on types of phobia for more information.</li> 
			<li> 3.  <u>Panic disorder</u> – This means having regular or frequent panic attacks without a clear cause or trigger. Experiencing panic disorder can mean that you feel
			constantly afraid of having another panic attack, to the point that this fear itself can trigger your panic attacks. See our section on panic attacks for more information.</li> 
			<li> 4.  <u>Phobias</u> – A phobia is an extreme fear or anxiety triggered by a particular situation (such as going outside) or a particular object (such as spiders). See our resource on phobias for more information.</li> 
			<li> 5.  <u>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</u> – This is a diagnosis you may be given if you develop anxiety problems after going through something you found traumatic.</li> 
			<li> 6.  <u>Health anxiety</u> – This means you experience obsessions and compulsions relating to illness, including researching symptoms or checking to see if you have them. </li>
			<li> 7.  <u>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</u> – You may be given this diagnosis if your anxiety problems involve having repetitive thoughts, behaviours or urges.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><u><B>What causes Anxiety?</B></u></h2>
		<h3>
			Anxiety may be caused by a mental condition, a physical condition, the effects of drugs, stressful life events, or a combination of these. The doctor's initial task is to see if your anxiety is a symptom of another medical condition. Anxiety disorders are different from normal anxiety.
			Everyone's experience of anxiety is different, so it's hard to know exactly what causes anxiety problems. There are probably lots of factors involved.
		</h3>
    </p>
	<br/>
	
	<p>
		<h2><u><B>How is Anxiety Diagnosed?<B></u></h2>
		<h3>
			you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy):
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Give you a psychological evaluation</u></B>: This involves discussing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems — such as depression or substance misuse — which can make diagnosis more challenging.
		</ol>
		<ol>	
			<B>2. <u>Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5</u></B>: Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder.
		</ol>

		<h2><u>Treatments and Therapies.</u></h2>
	    <h3>
			Anxiety disorders are generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. There are many ways to treat anxiety, and you should work with a health care provider to choose the best treatment for you.
		<li>Psychotherapy</li>
		<ol>1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</ol>
		<ol>2. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</ol>

		<li>Medication</li>
		<ol>1. Antidepressants</ol>
		<ol>2. Anti-anxiety Medications</ol>
		<ol>3. Beta-blockers</ol>
		<ol>4. Choosing the Right Medication</ol>
        </h3>
	</p>
	<br/>

	<p>
		<h2><u>Beyond Treatment you can also do.</u></h2>
		<h3>
		<ol>	
			<B>1. <u>Keeping a Life Chart</u> </B> <br>
			Even with proper treatment, mood changes can occur. Treatment is more effective when a patient and health care provider work together and talk openly about concerns and choices. Keeping a life chart that records daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events can help patients and health care providers track and treat bipolar disorder over time. Patients can easily share data collected via smartphone apps – including self-reports, self- ratings, and activity data – with their health care providers and therapists.
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<B>2. <u>Regular Excercise</u> </B> <br>
			Regular aerobic exercise, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or bicycling, helps with depression and anxiety, promotes better sleep, and is healthy for your heart and brain. There is also some evidence that anaerobic exercise such as weightlifting, yoga, and Pilates can be helpful. Check with your health care provider before you start a new exercise regimen.
		</ol>

		<h2><u>Coping up with Anxiety.</u></h2>
		<h3>
		To cope with an anxiety disorder, here's what you can do:
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Learn about your disorder</u></B>: To your doctor or mental health provider. Find out what might be causing your specific condition and what treatments might be best for you. Involve your family and friends and ask for their support.</br>
			<B>2. <u>Stick to your treatment plan</u></B>: Take medications as directed. Keep therapy appointments and complete any assignments your therapist may give you. Consistency can make a big difference, especially when it comes to taking your medication.</br>
			<B>3. <u>Take action</u></B>: Learn what triggers your anxiety or causes you stress. Practice the strategies you developed with your mental health provider so you're ready to deal with anxious feelings in these situations.</br>
			<B>4. <u>Keep a journal</u></B>: Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health provider identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.</br>
			<B>5. <u>Join an anxiety support group</u></B>: Remember that you aren't alone. Support groups offer compassion, understanding and shared experiences. The National Alliance on Mental Illness and the Anxiety and Depression Association of America provide information on finding support.</br>
			<B>6. <u>Learn time management techniques</u></B>: You can reduce anxiety by learning how to carefully manage your time and energy.</br>
			<B>7. <u>Socialize</u></B>: Don't let worries isolate you from loved ones or activities.</br>
			<B>8. <u>Break the cycle</u></B>: When you feel anxious, take a brisk walk or delve into a hobby to refocus your mind away from your worries.</br>
