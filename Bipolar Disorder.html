        <h2> <u>What is Bipolar Disorder?</u></h2>
       <h3> Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).
        When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable.
        These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.
        Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.
        Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy).

		<h2><u>What are types of Bipolar disorder?</u></h2>
        <h3>
			There are three basic types of bipolar disorder; all of them involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods range from periods of extremely “up,” elated, and energized behavior or increased activity levels (manic episodes) to very sad, “down,” hopeless, or low activity-level periods (depressive episodes). People with bipolar disorder also may have a normal (euthymic) mood alternating with depression. Four or more episodes of mania or depression in a year are termed “rapid cycling.”
			Some commonly diagnosed anxiety disorders are:
			<ul>
			<li> 1. <u> Bipolar I Disorder</u> – Bipolar I Disorder is defined by manic episodes that last at least seven days (most of the day, nearly every day) or when manic symptoms are so severe that hospital care is needed. Usually, separate depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least two weeks. Episodes of mood disturbance with mixed features (having depression and manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible..</li> <br>
			<li> 2.  <u>Bipolar II Disorder</u> – Bipolar II Disorder is defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes described above..</li> <br>
			<li> 3.  <u>Cyclothymic Disorder</u> – Cyclothymic Disorder (also called cyclothymia) is defined by persistent hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are not intense enough or do not last long enough to qualify as hypomanic or depressive episodes. The symptoms usually occur for at least two years in adults and for one year in children and teenagers..</li> <br>
			<li> 4.  <u>Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS)</u> – Diagnosed when symptoms of the illness exist but do not meet diagnostic criteria for either bipolar I or II. However, the symptoms are clearly out of the person’s normal range of behavior..</li> <br>
		</ul>

		<h2><u>What are the symptoms of Bipolar disorder?</u></h2>
        <h3>
			The symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary. An individual with bipolar disorder may have manic episodes, depressive episodes, or “mixed” episodes. A mixed episode has both manic and depressive symptoms. These mood episodes cause symptoms that last a week or two or sometimes longer. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day. Mood episodes are intense. The feelings are intense and happen along with changes in behavior, energy levels, or activity levels that are noticeable to others.<br>

		<h2><u>What causes Bipolar Disorder?</u></h2>
		    <h3>
		    The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. However, research suggests that there is no single cause. Instead, a combination of factors may contribute to bipolar disorder
		<ol>
			<B> 1. <U>  Genes </U></B><br>
			Bipolar disorder often runs in families, and research suggests that this is mostly explained by heredity—people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar disorder than others. Many genes are involved, and no one gene can cause the disorder.But genes are not the only factor. Some studies of identical twins have found that even when one twin develops bipolar disorder, the other twin may not. Although people with a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder are more likely to develop the disorder themselves, most people with a family history of bipolar disorder will not develop the illness.
	    </ol>
	    <ol>
		    <B> 2. <U>  Brain structure and Function </U></B><br>
		    Researchers are learning that the brain structure and function of people with bipolar disorder may be different from the brain structure and function of people who do not have bipolar disorder or other psychiatric disorders. Learning about the nature of these brain changes helps doctors better understand bipolar disorder and may in the future help predict which types of treatment will work best for a person with bipolar disorder. At this time, diagnosis is based on symptoms rather than brain imaging or other diagnostic tests.
	    </ol>

	<br/>


	<p>
		<h2><u>Conditions That Can Co-Occur With Bipolar Disorder</u></h2>
		<h3>
		Many people with bipolar disorder also may have other mental health disorders or conditions such as:
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Psychosis</u> </B> <br>
			Sometimes people who have severe episodes of mania or depression also have psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions. The psychotic symptoms tend to match the person’s extreme mood.
		</ol>
		<ol>	
			<B>2. <u>Anxiety Disorders Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</u> </B> <br>
			Anxiety disorders and ADHD often are diagnosed in people with bipolar disorder.
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<B>3. <u>Misuse of Drugs or Alcohol</u> </B> <br>
			People with bipolar disorder are more prone to misusing drugs or alcohol.
        </ol>
		<ol>
			<B>4. <u>Eating Disorders</u> </B> <br>
			People with bipolar disorder occasionally may have an eating disorder, such as binge eating or bulimia.
		</ol>

		<h2><u>How is Bipolar Diagnosed?</u></h2>
		<h3>
		To diagnose bipolar disorder, a doctor or other health care provider may:
		<ol>
			<B>1. Complete a full physical exam.</B> <br>
		</ol>
		<ol>	
			<B>2. Order medical testing to rule out other illnesses.</B> <br>
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<B>3. Refer the person for an evaluation by a psychiatrist.</B> <br>

		<h2><u>Treatments and Therapies.</u></h2>
	    <h3>
			Treatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar disorder. An effective treatment plan usually includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy.”Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness. Episodes of mania and depression typically come back over time. Between episodes, many people with bipolar disorder are free of mood changes, but some people may have lingering symptoms. Long-term, continuous treatment can help people manage these symptoms.
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Psychotherapy</u> </B> <br>
		    Psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy,” can be an effective part of the treatment plan for people with bipolar disorder.Psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can provide support, education, and guidance to people with bipolar disorder and their families. Treatment may include therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychoeducation, which are used to treat a variety of conditions.Treatment may also include newer therapies designed specifically for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) and family-focused therapy. Determining whether intensive psychotherapeutic intervention at the earliest stages of bipolar disorder can prevent or limit its full-blown onset is an important area of ongoing research.
		</ol>
		<ol>	
			<B>2. <u>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</u> </B> <br>
			ECT is a brain stimulation procedure that can help people get relief from severe symptoms of bipolar disorder. With modern ECT, a person usually goes through a series of treatment sessions over several weeks. ECT is delivered under general anesthesia and is safe. It can be effective in treating severe depressive and manic episodes, which occur most often when medication and psychotherapy are not effective or are not safe for a particular patient. ECT can also be effective when a rapid response is needed, as in the case of suicide risk or catatonia (a state of unresponsiveness).
		</ol>
		<ol>
			<B>3. <u>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</u> </B> <br>
			TMS is a newer approach to brain stimulation that uses magnetic waves. It is delivered to an awake patient most days for 1 month. Research shows that TMS is helpful for many people with various subtypes of depression, but its role in the treatment of bipolar disorder is still under study.
        </ol>
        </h3>
	</p>
	<br/>

	<p>
		<h2><u>Beyond Treatment you can also do.</u></h2>
		<h3>
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Regular Excercise</u> </B> <br>
			Regular aerobic exercise, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or bicycling, helps with depression and anxiety, promotes better sleep, and is healthy for your heart and brain. There is also some evidence that anaerobic exercise such as weightlifting, yoga, and Pilates can be helpful. Check with your health care provider before you start a new exercise regimen.
		</ol>
		<ol>	
			<B>2. <u>Keeping a Life Chart</u> </B> <br>
			Even with proper treatment, mood changes can occur. Treatment is more effective when a patient and health care provider work together and talk openly about concerns and choices. Keeping a life chart that records daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events can help patients and health care providers track and treat bipolar disorder over time. Patients can easily share data collected via smartphone apps – including self-reports, self- ratings, and activity data – with their health care providers and therapists.
		</ol>

		<h2><u>Coping up with Bipolar.</u></h2>
		<h3>
		Living with bipolar disorder can be challenging, but there are ways to help make it easier for yourself, a friend, or a loved one.
		<ol>
			<B>1. Get treatment and stick with it—recovery takes time and it’s not easy. But treatment is the best way to start feeling better.</B> <br>
			<B>2. Keep medical and therapy appointments and talk with the provider about treatment options.</B> <br>
			<B>3. Take all medicines as directed.</B> <br>
			<B>4. Structure activities: keep a routine for eating and sleeping, and make sure to get enough sleep and exercise.</B> <br>
			<B>5. Learn to recognize your mood swings and warning signs, such as decreased sleep.</B> <br>
			<B>6. Ask for help when trying to stick with your treatment.</B> <br>
			<B>7. Be patient; improvement takes time. Social support helps.</B> <br>
			<B>8. Avoid misuse of alcohol and drugs.</B> <br>
