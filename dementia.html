        <h2> <u>What is Dementia Disorder?</u></h2>
       <h3>Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change. Dementia ranges in severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of living.
		Dementia is more common as people grow older (about one-third of all people age 85 or older may have some form of dementia) but it is not a normal part of aging. Many people live into their 90s and beyond without any signs of dementia.
        There are several different forms of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. A person’s symptoms can vary depending on the type

		<h2><u>What are types of Dementia disorder?</u></h2>
        <h3>
			Dementias can be divided into three groups: 
			<ol>1. Primary (diseases and conditions in which dementia is the main illness).</ol>
			<ol>2. Secondary (dementia due to another disease or condition).</ol>
			<ol>3. Reversible (dementia-like symptoms caused by other illnesses or causes). </ol><br>

			<li>
		    <B> <U>Primary Dementia</U></B><br>
			Types of primary dementia include:
				
					<ol>1.<u>Alzheimer’s disease</u>: This is the most common type of dementia. Two abnormal proteins build up in your brain: tau and amyloid proteins. These proteins disrupt communication between nerve cells in your brain. Nerve cells die, starting in one area and spreading as more nerve cells die in other areas. Symptoms include short-term memory loss, confusion, personality and behavior changes. Trouble talking, remembering distant memories and issues with walking happen later in the disease. Alzheimer’s disease mainly affects adults who are older — up to 10% of those over age 65 and about 50% of people older than 85 have the disease. Family history is an important risk factor. Approximately 60% to 80% of people with dementia have this type.</ol>
					<ol>2.<u>Vascular dementia</u>: This is the second most common type of dementia. It’s caused by conditions such as strokes or atherosclerosis, which block and damage blood vessels in your brain. Symptoms include memory problems, confusion and trouble concentrating and completing tasks. The decline may appear suddenly (following a major stroke) or in steps (following a series of mini strokes). Risk factors include high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol levels. About 15% to 25% of people with dementia have vascular dementia.</ol>
					<ol>3.<u>Lewy body dementia</u>: This condition involves the buildup of clumps of proteins — called Lewy bodies — in your brain’s nerve cells. Lewy bodies damage nerve cells. Symptoms include movement and balance problems, changes in sleep patterns, memory loss, planning and problem-solving difficulties, and visual hallucinations and delusions. About 5% to 10% of dementias are Lewy Body dementia.</ol>
					<ol>4.<u>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)</u>: This dementia results from damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of your brain. The damage is caused by the buildup of abnormal proteins in these areas. It causes changes in social behavior, personality, and/or loss of language skills (speaking, understanding or forgetting the meaning of common words) or motor coordination. FTD is a common cause of early dementia, often occurring in people between the ages of 45 and 64. Between 5% and 6% of all dementias are FTD.</ol>
					<ol>5.<u>Mixed dementia</u>: This is a combination of two or more types of dementia. The most common combination is Alzheimer’s disease with vascular dementia. It’s most common in people 80 years of age and over. It’s often hard to diagnose because symptoms of one dementia may be more obvious and/or many symptoms of each type overlap. The decline is faster in people who have mixed dementia compared with those who only have one type.</ol>
					<br>
			</li>
            
			<li>
				<B> <U>Secondary Dementia</U></B><br>
				Types of Secondary dementia include:
					
						<ol>1.<u>Huntington’s disease</u>: A single defective gene causes this brain disorder. The disease causes a breakdown in your brain’s nerve cells, which causes body movement control problems, as well as thinking, decision-making and memory trouble, and personality changes.</ol>
						<ol>2.<u>Parkinson’s disease</u>: Many people in the later stages of Parkinson’s disease develop dementia. Symptoms include trouble with thinking and memory, hallucinations and delusions, depression and trouble with speech.</ol>
						<ol>3.<u>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</u>: This rare infective brain disease affects about only 1 in 1 million people. An abnormal protein in your brain called prions causes the disease. These prions clump together and cause nerve cell death in your brain. Symptoms include problems with thinking, memory, communication, planning and/or judgment, confusion, behavior changes, agitation and depression.</ol>
						<ol>4.<u>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome</u>: This brain disorder is caused by a severe thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This can result in bleeding in key areas related to memory in your brain. It’s most commonly caused by alcohol use disorder but can also be due to malnutrition and chronic infection. Symptoms include double vision, loss of muscle coordination, and difficulty processing information, learning new skills and remembering things.</ol>
						<ol>5.<u>Traumatic brain injury</u>: Repeated blows to your head can cause this injury. It’s most often seen in football players, boxers, soldiers and people who’ve had a vehicle accident. Dementia symptoms, which appear years later, include memory loss, behavior or mood changes, slurred speech and headaches.</ol>
						<br>
				</li>

				<li>
					<B> <U>Reversible Dementia</U></B><br>
					Types of Reversible dementia include:
						
							<ol>1.<u>Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)</u>: This condition happens when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in your brain’s spaces (ventricles). The excess buildup harms your brain. NPH can be caused by a brain infection, brain injury, brain bleed or previous brain surgery. Symptoms include poor balance, forgetfulness, trouble paying attention, mood swings, frequent falls and loss of bladder control. Your healthcare provider can drain excess fluid through the surgical placement of a shunt (tube)..</ol>
							<ol>2.<u>Vitamin deficiency</u>: Not getting enough vitamin B1, B6, B12 cooper and vitamin E in your diet can cause dementia-like symptoms..</ol>
							<ol>3.<u>Infections</u>:  Infections that can cause dementia-like symptoms include HIV infection, syphilis and Lyme disease. Symptoms reported with COVID-19 infection include “brain fog” and acute delirium. Because of the inflammation and stroke risk seen with COVID-19 infection, both short- and long-term cognitive effects are being investigated. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and infections in your lungs in the elderly can also result in dementia-like symptoms. Other central nervous system infections and brain infections caused by fungi, bacteria and parasites can also cause cognitive symptoms..</ol>
							<ol>4.<u>Metabolic and endocrine conditions</u>: Conditions that can mimic dementia include Addison’s disease, Cushing’s disease, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) exposure to heavy metals (like arsenic or mercury), high calcium levels (hypercalcemia, often due to hyperparathyroidism), liver cirrhosis and thyroid problems.</ol>
							<ol>5.<u>Medication side effects</u>:  Some medications, in some people, can mimic dementia symptoms. These include sleeping pills, anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, anti-seizure drugs, antiparkinson drugs, nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, narcotic pain relievers, statins and others. Ask your healthcare provider to review your medications if you have any dementia-like symptoms.</ol>
							<ol>6.<u>Other causes</u>: Other causes of dementia-like symptoms include brain tumors and subdural hematomas (brain bleeds between your brain’s surface and the covering over your brain).</ol>

		<h2><u>What are the symptoms of Dementia disorder?</u></h2>
        <h3>
			Dementia affects each person in a different way, depending upon the underlying causes, other health conditions and the person’s cognitive functioning before becoming ill. The signs and symptoms linked to dementia can be understood in three stages.
			<br>
				<center><img src="images/Dementia2.jpeg" width="30%"  style="border: 3px solid black;"></center>
				<B> <U>Early Stage </U></B><br>
				The early stage of dementia is often overlooked because the onset is gradual. Common symptoms may include:
				<ol>
					<li>forgetfulness</li>
					<li>losing track of the time</li>
					<li>becoming lost in familiar places</li>
					<br>
			    </ol>
				<ol>
					<B> <U>Middle stage </U></B><br>
					As dementia progresses to the middle stage, the signs and symptoms become clearer and may include::
					<li>Becoming forgetful of recent events and people's names</li>
					<li>Becoming confused while at home</li>
					<li>Having increasing difficulty with communication</li>
					<li>Needing help with personal care</li>
					<li>Experiencing behaviour changes, including wandering and repeated questioning</li><br>
					
			</ol>
			<ol>
				<B> <U>Last stage </U></B><br>
				The late stage of dementia is one of near total dependence and inactivity. Memory disturbances are serious and the physical signs and symptoms become more obvious and may include:
				<li>Becoming unaware of the time and place</li>
				<li>Having difficulty recognizing relatives and friends</li>
				<li>Having an increasing need for assisted self-care</li>
				<li>Having difficulty walking</li>
				<li>Experiencing behaviour changes that may escalate and include aggression.</li>

		<h2><u>What causes Dementia Disorder?</u></h2>
		    <h3>
			Dementia is caused by damage to your brain. Dementia affects your brain’s nerve cells, which destroys your brain’s ability to communicate with its various areas. Dementia can also result from blocked blood flow to your brain, depriving it of needed oxygen and nutrients. Without oxygen and nutrients, brain tissue dies.
            Damage to your brain results in different symptoms, depending on the area of your brain affected. Some dementias aren’t reversible and will worsen over time. Other dementias are due to other medical conditions that also affect your brain. Another group of health issues can result in dementia-like symptoms. Many of these conditions are treatable, and the dementia symptoms are reversible.
            </h3>
    </p>
	<br/>


	<p>
		<h2><u>How is Dementia Diagnosed?</u></h2>
		<h3>
		Confirming a diagnosis of dementia can be difficult. Many diseases and conditions can cause or lead to dementia. In addition, many of its symptoms are common to many other illnesses.
		<li>Your healthcare provider will: </li>
		<ol>1. Ask about the course of your symptoms. </ol>
		<ol>2. Ask about your medical history.</ol>
		<ol>3. Review your current medications</ol>
		<ol>4. Ask about your family history of disease including dementia.</ol>
		<li>They may also order tests, including laboratory tests, imaging tests and neurocognitive tests (thinking tests).</li>
		</h3>
	</p>
	<br/>

	<p>
		<h2><u>Treatments and Therapies.</u></h2>
	    <h3>
		There is currently no treatment available to cure dementia. Anti-dementia medicines and disease-modifying therapies developed to date have limited efficacy and are primarily labeled for Alzheimer’s disease, though numerous new treatments are being investigated in various stages of clinical trials.
        <li>Additionally, much can be offered to support and improve the lives of people with dementia and their carers and families. The principal goals for dementia care are:</li>
	    <ol>1. Early diagnosis in order to promote early and optimal management</ol>
	    <ol>2. optimizing physical health, cognition, activity and well-being</ol>
		<ol>3. Identifying and treating accompanying physical illness</ol>
		<ol>4. Understanding and managing behaviour changes</ol>
		<ol>5. Providing information and long-term support to carers.</ol>

		<h2><u>Risk Factory with Dementia disorder.</u></h2>
		<h3>
		Risk factory includes:
		<ol>
			<B>1. <u>Age</u></B>: This is the strongest risk factor. Your chance of dementia increases as you age. Most cases affect people over the age of 65.<br>
			<B>2.<u>Family history</u></B>: If you have biological parents or siblings with dementia, you’re more likely to develop dementia. <br>
			<B>3. <u>Down syndrome</u></B>: If you have Down syndrome, you’re at risk of developing early-onset Alzheimer’s disease by middle age. <br>
			<B>4. <u>Poor heart health</u></B>: If you have high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis or smoke, you increase your risk of dementia. These health problems, as well as diabetes, affect your blood vessels. Damaged blood vessels can lead to reduced blood flow and strokes.<br>
			<B>5. <u>Race and ethnicity</u></B>: If you’re a Black person, you have twice the risk as a white person for developing dementia. If you’re a Hispanic person, you’re 1.5 times more likely than a white person to develop dementia.<br>
			<B>6. <u>Brain injury</u></B>: If you’ve had a severe brain injury, you’re at a higher risk for dementia.<br>
